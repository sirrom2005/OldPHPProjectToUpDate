	<description><![CDATA[M. Myrie/D. Germain/H. Tucker/G. BrowneWhile I'm livingThanks I'll be givingTo the most high, you knowChorusI am living while I'm living to the father I will prayOnly He knows how we get through every dayWith all the hike in the priceArm and leg we have to payWhile our leaders playAll I see is people ripping and robbing and grabbing...Thief never love to see a thief with a long bag,No love for the people who are suffering real badAnother toll to the poll may God help we soulWhat is to stop the youths from getting out of controlFilled up with education yet don't own a payrollThe clothes on my back has countless eye holesChorusCould go on and on and full has never been toldChorusI say who can afford to run will runBut what about those who can't...they will have to stayOpportunity is a scarce commodityIn these times I say...when mama spend her last to send you to class...Never you ever playIt's a competitive world for low budget peopleSpending a dime while earning a nickelWith no regards to who it may tickleMy cup is full to the brimChorusCould go on and on the full has never been toldThrough this life keep getting me downDon't give up nowGot to survive some way some howChorus]]></description>

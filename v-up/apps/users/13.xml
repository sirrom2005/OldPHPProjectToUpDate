	<description><![CDATA[This 19 year old young man spend his mornings on the streets of Liguanea wiping windshields in order to help his family. He was asked one morning by FunInJ.A. (short) if he had a talent, and he responded that he could sing. The few minutes it took for the light to change to green gave 'Juvenile' ample opportunity to 'wow' us with his amazing voice.

The songs he sing and the passion in which he sings them depicts the true beauty that is innate within us all as Jamaicans. That is, which ever road blocks that we as Jamaicans face, our self-motivating spirit will overcome them. This is why Ricardo 'Juvenile' Richards is FunInJamaica.net's first Talent Exposure choice!]]></description>

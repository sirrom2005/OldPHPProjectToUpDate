            Baymac may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business

            your personal information except to provide these services to Baymac , and they
            are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.<br /><br />

            Baymac may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within
            Baymac, in order to determine what Baymac services and products are the most
            popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within

            conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Baymac
            or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Baymac ; and, (c) act
            under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Baymac ,
            or the public.<br /><br />

            <strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br />
            The Baymac website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
            experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web
            page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
            computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web
            server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br /><br />

            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to
            save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
            returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Baymac pages,
            or register with Baymac site or services, a cookie helps Baymac to recall your
            specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
            your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and
            so on. When you return to the same Baymac website, the information you
            previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Baymac features
            that you customized.<br /><br />

            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
            to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not
            be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Baymac services or
            websites you visit.<br /><br />

            <strong>International Users</strong><br />
            The Service is controlled, operated and administered by Baymac and are
            subject to the laws of the British Virgin Islands . If you access the Service from a location outside
            the British Virgin Islands, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws. You agree that
            you will not use the Baymac Content accessed through http://www.baymac.net in
            any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws, restrictions or
            regulations.<br /><br />

            directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any losses, costs, liabilities

    <div class="clr"></div>
    
    <p><strong>Why Should I Buy International Health Insurance?</strong>
    
    For
expats, the answer is easy. For an expatriate living abroad, traditional
sources of private health insurance (like in the United States) may not
be adequate. Overseas geographical exclusions and health provider
limitations common to these policies will restrict or even eliminate the
coverage available to expatriates while outside their home country.
At the same time, expats may not be eligible for participation in the
government­sponsored plans in the country where they reside, or they
may wish to have access to health care in other countries, including the
U.S., in the event they or any covered member of their family were to
become seriously ill.

    <p><strong>Does the Atlas Travel International Plan Provide Any Home
Country Coverage?</strong><br />
	Yes. Atlas International and Atlas America will provide foreign
visitors with limited Home Country Coverage. However, there are two
types of coverage in the home country, all of which are restricted to
medical expenses only:<br />

Benefit Period – In the event a Member begins a Benefit Period while
the Certificate is in effect, and the Certificate terminates because the
Member returns to his/her Home Country, the Atlas Travel Series will
pay Eligible Medical Expenses that are incurred in the Member's Home
Country during the Benefit Period. Home Country Coverage applies
only to Eligible Medical Expenses related to the Injury or Illness that
began while the Certificate was in effect.
<br />
Incidental Home Country Coverage – For each three (3) months during
which a Member is covered under the Atlas Travel Series, Medical
Expenses only are covered during incidental trips totaling no more
than 15 days duration per three­month period of coverage. Incidental
visit time must be used within the three­month period earned, and the
Member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible
for this benefit. Return to the Member's Home Country must not be
taken for the purpose of obtaining treatment of an Illness or Injury that
began while traveling.

                <p><strong>How Do I Extend or Renew My Atlas Travel Insurance
Coverage?</strong><br />
	After your initial purchase, you may extend your coverage (5 day
minimum) up to a maximum of 364 days from the initial effective date.
Provided there is no break in coverage, you will not be required to re­
satisfy the Deductible and Coinsurance nor will benefit limits be reset. If
you are covered under Atlas International, after 364 days of continuous
coverage you may renew your coverage for up to two additional
coverage periods. Deductible and Coinsurance must be re­satisfied as
of each renewal date. If a new application is required, then you must
re­satisfy your Deductible, Coinsurance and Pre­existing Condition
provisions. Extensions or renewals must be made online in the Client
Zone with payment by credit card.

                <p><strong>Which CitizenSecure® Coverage Area is Right for Me?</strong><br />
                	CitizenSecure® offers two coverage areas: Including the U.S. and
Canada and Excluding the U.S. and Canada. If you are an expatriate
who desires worldwide health coverage, select the "Including the U.S.
and Canada" option. If you desire worldwide health coverage except
in the U.S. and Canada, you will likely find more affordable expat
insurance with lower premiums by selecting the "Excluding the U.S. and
Canada" option.

    <p><strong>How Do I File a Claim with My CitizenSecure® Economy Plan?</strong><br />

Filing a claim for your CitizenSecure® Economy policy is easy.
Once your Application is accepted, you will receive a kit that
contains a Claimant's Statement and Authorization form. Complete
this Claimant's Statement and Authorization form, attach original,
itemized bills, and forward them to HCCMIS. Be sure to complete
your Claimant's Statement entirely and sign it. If you have already
paid certain expenses, attach copies of your payment receipts. You
will be reimbursed for eligible medical or dental expenses. In many
cases, HCCMIS will make payments directly to the hospital or physician
that treated you. Remember, you are responsible for the deductible,
coinsurance, and any ineligible charges.</p>

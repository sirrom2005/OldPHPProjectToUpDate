			<Char_Desc_450>This is a great program for any size pet boarding operation (dogs and cats). It's hard to stay organized in a small business, where everybody has a lot of hats to wear, and where customers expect your immediate reaction to their needs. If you don't do it, they are off to your competition. Managing any service company, you'll need to track customer's, schedules, watch the payments, and much more.

Kennel Manager software will help you present a professional appearance to your customers.

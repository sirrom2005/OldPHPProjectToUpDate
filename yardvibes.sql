The car was air-lifted in to Barbados in the same Virgin Atlantic 747-400 that carried the bulk of the European competitors, the first time in the history of Rally Carnival that air freight, rather than sea freight, has been used.</div>','<br />  <br /> <div style=\"text-align: justify\"> <br /><br />And one further piece of the puzzle will fall in place tomorrow afternoon, with the arrival of driver Perez and co-driver, Neil Dashfield, just in time for International Scrutineering, slated for 5.00pm at the Wildey premises of McEnearney Quality Inc. The now-traditional Friday evening presentation will include driver interviews, an official welcome of the overseas visitors and the chance for fans to mingle with competitors from home and abroad.<br /><br />In addition to the overseas entries, the leading local cars will also be undergoing the necessary safety checks; among them will be some that have been eagerly-awaited by local fans - the return of Trevor Manning\\&#39;s Simpson Motors Rally Team Mitsubishi Evo VIII, the public debuts of his team-mate Sean Gill\\&#39;s new Suzuki Swift, Sammy Cumberbatch\\&#39;s new BMW M3 and the reborn Mazda of Nick Gill.<br /><br />Chairman of the Rally Barbados organising committee Barry Gale said: &quot;It is an indication of the importance with which Steve Perez views the events of Rally Carnival that he was willing to fly his car to our island, so as to limit the amount of time that he would be without it back home.<br /><br />&quot;He had been leading the MSA National Gravel Championship again this year until his accident in the Isle of Man, and is missing the next round, which clashes directly with Rally Barbados. I very much hope he enjoys himself here this year, and that he goes home with a result that makes all his and his team\\&#39;s efforts worthwhile.&quot; Once scrutineering is done, Perez will have little time to acclimatise himself, as the first of the two Rally Carnival events falls on Saturday - the Red Bull International RallySprint is scheduled to start with qualifying at 10.00am and will be the first International event at the Vaucluse Raceway in St Thomas to be run into the night.<br /><br />This is not the award-winning British businessman\\&#39;s first visit to the Barbados Rally Carnival, and he is hoping the competition side of this one will last longer than before; having been unable to arrive in time for the International RallySprint, he then slid off the road on the Saturday morning of Rally Barbados 2004 and damaged his ex-Hannu Mikkola Audi Quattro Sport beyond immediate repair. Some consolation for him that year was victory in the hotly-competitive ANCRO National Rally Championshp in the UK at the wheel of a 2003 Focus WRC, his second British title in as many seasons, having claimed the Armajaro Historic crown in 2003 in a Porsche 911.<br /><br />His Rally Barbados 2006 campaign has been meticulously planned by BTR Preparations boss Tim Ashton and even the drama of an major accident just three weeks ago on the Manx National Rally has not derailed it.

I usually want to cool out, take a break from the hustle and bustle of the weekly grind(Monday to Friday work week) and just soak in some of the tropical paradise which whether we believe it or not we have here. This plan is usually ripped to shreds when upon arriving at the spot it is as crowded as a lotto shop at 6;55pm when the pot has soared past the 20 million dollar mark. As such to maintain sanity I usually remain home,bored stiff but sane and safe.</p>','<br /><br />This time around I was of the view that there was light at the end of what appeared to be a never ending tunnel of darkness. The life line came in the form of the Jamaica Race Drivers Club initiative to launch its first annual Labour Day Work Project at Dover. Honesty is the best policy. I will be the first to tell you that there is no better meaning to be provided for the word lazy, that a passport size picture of my frowning face next to the term in the dictionary could not defeat effortlessly. There was a section of the information released which demanded my attention. This line was the culprit &ndash; &lsquo;later in the day an informal driving/lapping school will be available courtesy of some of the veteran drivers who will be on hand&rsquo;. I searched high, low and in between and I saw neither cost nor entry fee. This was a show up, clean up Dover and be taught how to drive at Dover .The atom bomb that devastated Hiroshima did not produce the blast I carried in my head after I read that. There are times when you are told that if something sounds too good to be true it probably is. I was willing to find out.<br /><br />At Dover the sun did not realize it was a public holiday and as such it should be at rest. Hell no &ndash; get it &ndash; the sun was out in all its glory. The JAGAS group and others were busy at various sections of the circuit toiling in the brilliant tropical sunshine. The labour day project was on in earnest. It is very easy to recognize when persons out of their field expertise. Take painting for example, if you see more paint on the person than on the wall, you know he or she is out of his element. Team Mobay representatives were busy painting themselves (Kirk) and a little bit of the building. Teddy Burton was much more successful at story telling than he was at assisting the workmen in his pit area.<br /><br /> Some members of team RS spent more time labouring on Thomas&rsquo;s ride the than they did on anything else. Thomas had a hilarious drama relating to taking a corner at speed and feeling the seat turning with him! His seat did require immediate attention, so in my book they had a valid excuse. Ice at various stages appeared to be working, as to how successful he was or what he accomplished I will allow him to explain. Dean/Duct Tape was always focused on the task at hand and thought it was his responsibility to break up any little lime that would begin to distract the workers. At one a stage there was a raging debate about the popularity of Nascar and football and Dean had to intervene with the &lsquo;back to work order&rsquo;. Real slave driver. . Hollywood tried his hand at painting but did not realize that we do not use a roller to paint grills but paint he did.<br /><br />The con artists for the day must be David Summerbell Jr and Peter Rae. David carried his children, who adore their accomplished father. His daughter was busy defending his honor when we informed her that if he ever made the mistake of entering the IP 45 class next race meet he could call it quits as a result of the sound beating he would receive at the hands of the aspiring Schumachers. Without flinching her two questions were- &lsquo;1) my daddy and 2) what will he be driving. When our response was not to her liking she responded by saying &lsquo;you are scared&rsquo;. Their admiration was evident. It was pretty obvious that David is the man to check for pointers as to how to successfully brainwash your child. As I said con artist number one, David, was busier with his kids than with any thing else, providing parental care. Peter Rae on the other hand had his workman present so guess who did all the work &ndash; Peter, God forbid &ndash;he might hurt a nail. Based on what I saw the Jagas fellows did a lot of work and should be commended for their effort. Most of the persons who were at the venue, pitched in and played a role, despite how minute it might have been. Picture this, Monique in a one of those jeans pants that women have to jump in to get them to fit. So the picture is Monique in that pair of jeans, a T-shirt a few sizes too small (referred to as tight blouse) and now add to the outfit a broom. Yes she was very busy sweeping from corner to corner in the pits. <br /><br />Food was available and after a little price arrangement (half cost) it was lunch time. At the end of that much needed break Doug went around to the various pits and announced that it was time for the convoy. The convoy would see persons going around the track in their cars following one of the veterans. Yes, it was really happening this was no dream, no politicians promise, no promise is comfort to a fool. A second or third announcement was not necessary &ndash; all drivers and non drivers were ready to go. Who would not want to run laps around the circuit.<br /><br /> Before we got the opportunity to experience the track an informal drivers meeting was held on track. At this stage it was explained in no uncertain terms that this was definitely not a race. The purpose of the exercise was twofold. Individuals will be taught the lines of the circuit and also individuals will be allowed to have fun under supervision. The veterans to lead each group were Doug, Dean and Teddy. We formed our lines, 5 cars behind each veteran (Teddy was given veteran status for the day) and off we went . <br /><br />I took the liberty of planting myself in Kirk&rsquo;s Evo 6 to get a view and experience the track from the passenger seat. As was explained by the veterans Dover was very hard on the car. David spent a lot of time explaining that during a break in the runs. In about 3-4 laps the cars were brought in to cool down. If you are a fan of scents race related &ndash;disc pads, fuel etc., you would have had your fill. I remember a Team RS member remarking &lsquo;smell the fumes&rsquo;.<br /><br /> The convoy was for familiarization but that could not prepare me for the next segment. The second segment saw the veterans driving the various cars with the owners and others who were brave enough to sit in them during the assault. As stated I was rooted in the Evo 6 and as such when Doug decided to drive the Evo 6 I became back seat passenger. Doug is someone who I would have known as a regular at every thing Jamaican motor sports. I have seen him in action and I have been fortunate to witness some of his exploits when he changes gear and becomes &lsquo;Hollywood&rsquo;. I will give an example the last sprint in Ironshore he did a 360 with the evo and on the second revolution he stopped midway slipped the car in reverse and drove into the pits perfect parking. Mobay was senseless money, liquor and women were being thrown in the air in celebration of a dramatic stunt by their local actor. I say all that to say this, I was comfortable all the way. I have read everything there is to read about the Evo but I have never been in one with a professional race car driver. During our assault on the circuit not only were we traveling at hair raising speeds, testing the traction, cornering and braking abilities of the Evo 6, Doug was also explaining as we drove what to do, what not to do, how to negotiate particular corners, which gear is best for the various corners and how to be smooth with gentle steering input etc. I obviously will not disclose some of the secrets he gave away he still has races ahead. I was shown how an Evo should be driven and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not get a chance to drive with Dean in the dew machine but I did get a chance to run a few laps with Ice in his machine. The runs I had in Ice&rsquo;s car and the runs I saw being made by Dean&rsquo;s car and based on the comments being made by all the persons who either drove or drove in the Type R I will not hesitate to give the cars the respect they deserve. They are excellent cars and that was made abundantly clear on the track. All the persons who showed up were allowed to participate and participate they did.<br /><br /><br />In the final analysis we all had fun, we were allowed to run until the sun decided to leave us Doug ran the wind out of 2 evos when he was through an egg could be fried on the rotors of the cars. I must say thanks to the veterans, it was appreciated and I hope that similar type events will be planned to get more persons involved at the competing level. Yes, Dean the Honda Type R is truly a remarkable car. What I found most interesting was the fact that the 71 horsepower Toyota Vitz that Teddy drove was such a competent performer on track. At one stage Ice was keeping close tabs on the BZR during one of the runs. Thomas spent some time very very close to the wall, he had his partner uncomfortable at time to time. We told her he was ok that was the correct line . This is not the tell all piece, you should have been there . Again thanks veterans lesson for the day delivered &ndash; skill is stronger than strength.<br /><br /><br /><br />Machine Deh Ya!',1,1,0,1,'2004-07-07 11:54:06',62,'','2006-07-29 15:25:01',62,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2004-07-07 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','car2.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=',12,0,18,'','',0,40),(7,'Example News Item 2','News2','<p>{mosimage}Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat,\r\nsed diam voluptua.

The World Cup is over! As expected, Brazil broke several billion hearts.Ladies ripped their hair out in disbelief and men wept openly as the Samba came to an abrupt end and the Kings of football were politely asked to take the next flight out. Being a student of history, I have learnt from the past. I remembered the great Brazilian teams of the past which had so much promise and delivered very little. Just think back to the team with the great Dr. Socrates , Zico Falco, Eder and company .','They are often regarded as the best Brazilian team not to win the World Cup. As such I was willing to simply watch and enjoy the games. When all the shouting is over we will remember Zidane leaving his bag of tricks behind for the final game and resorting to cave man like head butting tactics to resolve disputes and as some would argue thus removing the rudder from the rapidly sinking French ship. In true Don Corleone style Italy made the French an offer they could not refuse. The details of the offer were not made available to me &ndash; did someone say &lsquo;match fixing&rsquo;. Congratulations Italy you are now almost as good as Brazil (now that you have won the cup four times).So our lives will return to normal, at least for now, and we will continue to work like slaves for the paltry sums we receive and refer to it as a salary.<br /> <br /> The good news. It is summer ! To the career oriented, patriotic, responsible, taxpaying citizen this means absolutely nothing. To the rest of us &ndash;carefree, time wasting, idle chatting, motor racing, girl watching, often in a trance deciding which is more important my girl or my car, my car, my car or my who? This means everything! The party season has officially begun and we will spend countless hours trying in futility to clone ourselves so we can attend as much of these sessions as is humanly possible.<br /> <br /> Hot Wheels Beach party on the same day as the world cup final meant that most persons would roll out in the late afternoon after the joy or the pain subsided. That was not the case. Apparently persons were keen to show their rides and as such a lot of the &lsquo;Hot Wheels&rsquo; were available to be viewed early in the afternoon. It was definitely a family affair based on the various games, play areas and attractions created for children. They could be seen frolicking about and making the most of their newly discovered freedom. I will not digress. The main ride area, immediately behind the stage had some wild rides. These rides were positioned by design, in front of their major sponsor Tyre Wharehouse &ndash; Team Federal. The rides included selections from Vibes Racing and others &ndash; Ramdial&rsquo;s track tested and proven Honda, the much talked about, seeing is believing, BMW M3,Travis&rsquo;akaWhiteboy Honda Integra Type R, AMJ&rsquo;S Wrecking old school V8 Ford Mustang, Mitchie&rsquo;s Honda Integra Type R and the list gores on. Not to be out done, the other &lsquo;Hot Wheels&rsquo; were scattered all over the venue.<br /> <br />  The Team Myzery members formed a line for themselves - Geo, Singapore, Peter, Oniel, Facious and the rest of the crew had their rides on display. The Big Black Dodge rammed its way into the venue, a Z3 got comfortable in the grass, a classic MG made friends with a well dressed Evo V, the Kolors and Koncepts ride decided to take centre stage and found a spot for itself, an Evo MR thought it necessary to hide from the masses and decided to reside to the far left of the venue. There were numerous other vehicles lining the sloping area close to the entrance .The Crazy Bikers with Team leader Cutter made an appearance and cooled their high revving rockets at the summit of one of the hills at the venue. The rides all together created a beautiful spectacle and when you add the adorable Nubian princesses who were present a perfect haven was created for car guys. For the most part the ladies came dressed for the occasion. It is a beach who needs a three piece suit? The women were less than skimpily attired and this made some of the men very uneasy especially those who carried &lsquo;sand to the beach&rsquo; and had to keep their heads straight each time a voluptuous female glided by. Committed relationships took a beating &ndash; they were tested and I am certain some failed- anything for women.<br /> <br /> The entertainment package, directed by Melva was well received. Melva is without a doubt one of the best in her field. She was able to create and maintain broad grins on the face of the patrons with her pronouncements. One or her most popular being &lsquo;Tek whe yuself&rsquo; which always brought laughter. Not a dull moment with Melva in the building. The on stage action included numerous prizes &ndash;17 inch rims, caps, gift baskets etc. for almost anything. For example first man with big foot on stage, name the branches of Tyre Wharehouse, first man on stage with a top from a two piece etc. The Finesse models made an appearance and graced the &lsquo;wheels walk&rsquo; in some interesting outfits. The most popular being the bags parading as tops so just enough could be seen by the unrestricted inmates at the front of the stage. Girlfriends had a difficult time keeping their partners subdued. In one segment of the proceedings, during the Dutty Wine contest there were 2 interesting occurrences. The first involved the appearance of the 6 legged contestant &ndash; the crab- which forced the young ladies to complete a disappearing act only seen in movies like the Mummy or X-men. The second incident not seen by most patrons, involved one of the contestants. wining and hanging precariously from the edge of the stage until she fell off the stage. When she resurfaced, unscathed but shaken she calmly took her spot on the stage. It was all good.<br /> <br /> During a lull in the activities Team Myzery and Mitchie decided to take the entertainment to the next level. For anywhere between 10 &ndash; 30 minutes an all out flame throwing war ensued. At the end of very loud popping sounds and several feet of flames it appeared as if Geo was declared the winner. H was able to rev the ride and when off throttle you would hear the loud popping sound ( similar to the sound heard when a hand-gun is fired).He did this repeatedly while Singapore was busy throwing dragon like flames from his immaculate Honda.<br /> <br /> Coppershot and Bass Odyssey handled the music duties and up to point when we left they were doing a very good job. Hot Wheels Bach party had good vibes, the crews came out, the ladies were their usual voluptuous selves I saw no major disturbances. Good clean fun without the usual hiccups . Well done promoters.

I am stationed in the nation&rsquo;s capital and its environs so I am not in the best position to speak to what is in occurrence in Jamaica&rsquo;s other towns and rural areas. What I do know is the fact that the &lsquo;official&rsquo; drag racing season is slowly evolving into one of those mysteries that only a Sidney Sheldon or Alfred Hitchcock may unravel.&nbsp;','I am constantly hounded by persons who are concerned as to whether or not there will be an official event any time soon. It is already a difficult situation when events are not being held on a regular basis and based on observations salt is dumped into the wound when one tries to get word from the individuals who are referred to as the organizers of events. My two cents, not requested but being given without GCT - If meets will not go ahead as scheduled public announcements should be made in order to inform the fans islandwide.<br /><br />That said, Jamaicans worldwide are known for their creativity and their knack for taking advantage of little windows of opportunity. With disorganization rampant in officialdom a rebirth has occurred. This is no secret and it is growing at a rapid rate. I will not delay your suspense. The rebirth being referred to is &ndash; R.A.C.E.S. (Racing At Clarendon Every Sunday). The hardened racers with years of humorous tales in their repertoire will tell you that this was the norm in their era but, in recent times, drag racing on the calendar of events would be scheduled for the last Sunday in each month. As fate would have it this has not happened for some time now. So what do racers and fans do in the interim? They race!<strong><strong><strong>{mosgoogle right} </strong></strong></strong> They race on all the available Sundays in the month. Thanks in part to the happy go lucky Mandeville Racers Club, which is made up of several crews or teams and later joined and supported by the Portmore Racers with Team Myzery at the fore of the activities, Vernamfield on any given Sunday is a racers delight.<br /><br />I was approached by someone recently who asked what I thought about the unofficial racing at Vernamfield. I will tell you exactly what I think. It is clear that there are a number of persons who are not in support of the unofficial meets. A few of the individuals I have heard expressing this view are also a part of the organization which is responsible for the official meets so I can understand their stance. Just a reminder -&lsquo;when the cat&rsquo;s away the mice will play&rsquo;. In every thing we are entitled to our opinions and that should be respected whether we agree or disagree .My take on the unofficial meets is simple. The strip (Vernamfield) is there seven days a week why sit and wait for an official meet if drag racing is your preferred motorsport interest. If you want to tweak your cars performance or try to improve your ability or techniques as a drag racer, more power to you or simply race whoever go ahead on your chosen day and have fun while doing it. The benefits to be derived from these activities are numerous. One aspect being referred to here is the fact that the avenue is now present for a lot of enthusiasts who would not normally participate in an official events to participate in an activity which they are passionate about. At the same time, as some of the taxi fellows will tell you, the racing debates no longer play out on the nations streets. The disputes, bets, etc. can be brought to Vernamfield and settled under the watchful stare of the all conquering sun. Every dark cloud has a silver lining.<br /><br />Racers from all over are now traveling to Vernamfield to duke it out on the strip in a bid to see whose car is quicker or who is the better driver. This must be a plus in that if &lsquo;racers&rsquo; are allowed to conduct their activities(racing) in such an area as Vernamfield it may serve to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring on the streets due to the racing ambitions of a few. Whatever the future holds for Vernamfield a good thing is happening and if persons in authority, motorsports, government, etc. are interested they could look into creating facilities to allow motorsports or racing to be conducted in an area so designated in an attempt to take it from the streets.&nbsp;This is the direction in which the more developed countries are moving. There are even events at drag strips in the USA coordinated by members of the police force in an attempt to stop racing on the streets. There is no denying the blast of adrenalin one receives when accelerating along one&rsquo;s favorite section of roadway doing the Michael Schumacher impression but that same rush is best experienced on a strip or away from the public streets. If speed is your drug then a track somewhere should be your dealer. Our closest track or strip is located at Vernamfield Clarendon.<br /><br />So my take on the Unofficial events at Vernamfield on a Sunday &ndash; We need more Sundays in the year!<br /><br /><br />On a different note we are all saddened by the passing of the Ian Stewart and Steve Bailey in the unfortunate accident on Hope Road on Saturday(24/6/06). Freedom of speech allows us to say whatever we want but at the same time respect for others and common decency should guide our written and spoken words and as such we should exercise some amount of restraint in the things we post or say. Always think about the persons connected to the individuals in one way, shape or form who are in need of support and encouraging voices at a time like this.

Based on the scenario which unfolded at the Easter meet held at Dover (April &rsquo;06) there were individuals who I spoke to, who indicated that they left Dover with mixed feelings.&nbsp;','The high points included the introduction of the much anticipated IP 45 (street) class, the blistering but brief performance of Teddy&rsquo;s new ride, the always impressive Summerbell, and the presence of Bull Thompson. The major low point for most persons was the fact that the planned showdown involving the big guns did not materialize. In all fairness this was as a result of circumstances beyond their control, but were fans willing to accept that &ndash; hell no. This created a huge void in the lives of the true motor heads and the outcries for redress could be heard far and wide. The Internet junkies wasted no time. The colorful advertisement was bright and beautiful for all to see. Duct Tape was doing his usual public relations and sponsorship duties and the speed demons were all pining for the great day &ndash; &lsquo;Ooh what a day it will be when Vernam we shall see, rides in all their glory entertaining not only you but also me&rsquo;. <br /> <br /> {mosimage}The day did come, Sunday, May 7, 2006,the event dubbed the JMMC Kir Dex Transportation Service Sprint #3 was alive and well. On arriving at Vernam it was obvious that the word had gone around. We arrived at the beginning of the lunch break and at that time finding a parking spot in the most favored section of the venue(the section close to the race cars) could be compared to finding a beach in the Sahara. It was that bad, I saw drivers who I know did not buy their licence having an understandably so, rather difficult time trying to squeeze 6 feet wide vehicles into 4 feet wide spaces. At one stage we had a grand time looking at the frustrated faces of drivers while their female companions looked on helplessly. <br /> <br /> Based on the competitors list there were over 30 entrants for this Sprint who competed in 9 classes, driving motor vehicles made by 11 different manufacturers(Toyota, Mazda etc),so whatever you drove you would not feel neglected. On track the concrete served up a menu of scintillating performances laden with impressive times. There was obviously a renewed determination shown by several competitors who raised the bar that much higher in their respective classes. That said, mention must be made of Bobby Marshal whose steady progress earned him JA3 class champion, defeating the usual suspects including Dean &lsquo;the Honda advocate&rsquo; Corrudus and former navigator now reborn driver Pernell Fitz-Coy. When I spoke to Dean during the lunch break I did not get the impression that his weapon of choice was firing from all cylinders. Well done Bobby Marshal. {mosimage}<br /> <br /> In the JA2 class Tarik Minot driving his Toyota Starlet stamped his dominance on his unsuspecting classmates with a much heavier than lead right driving foot and precision fit for a surgeon. Tariq posted the quickest time for each run and also produced the best in class time of 1.58.88.Based on the financial resources I was told went into getting this ride to where it is I am happy that Tariq is seeing the fruits of his investment .Nothing encourages like success. I overheard Larry Henriques commenting during one of Tariq&rsquo;s ground pounding runs that &lsquo; Tariq a drive an it look like the program a work&rsquo;. Raj was not in his usual Team Xpress racing colored Mitsubishi Mirage which served him well in Mobay but he did not surrender without a valiant fight and as such he was justly rewarded for his efforts with second in class. The Andersons driving their family built Mitsubishi machines romped all over the JA4 class but had to contend with opposition from Thomas Hall in his Toyota Starlet. <br /> <br /> The JC1 class did not fail to live up to expectations .This class had the much talked about M.A.D machine driven by both Teddy and Xavia and it also included the rear wheel drive rides of Jeremy and Al Saddiq-Allie. During one of the runs I overheard persons saying they came solely to see the M.A.D machine because they got a little peak at Dover and were impressed. The new {mosimage}acquisition is another fine example of the master tuner Xavia at work. On his second run, Teddy was able to stop the clock at 1.55 but this was later adjusted as a result of contact at the plum tree chicane. When he made contact with the tyres Teddy was visibly upset with himself in the ride and could be seen hitting the steering wheel as he drove towards the sweeper. His intentions were clear ,he wanted to deliver on the promise of the superb ride. Unfortunately he told me that the manifold was cracked in his final run and as such to prevent further damage he wthdrew the ride from the championship run. There is no doubt that this is truly another MAD machine &ndash; just how we love them. Jeremy was his usual competitive self but he toned down the powerslides at the sweeper this time around <br /> <br /> The class which generated the most interest was the JA8 class. This was the class with only serious machines onboard. The battle for the heavyweight championship had seven contenders, six in the Evolution corner and one in the Ford corner. Let us first lay the cards on the table - there is no beating Gary Gregg when he is in attack mode. This is an era ahead, superior ride to the others in attendance and in the hands of a competent driver such as the Colonel, it goes without saying that the victor is a foregone conclusion. We take nothing from Gary ,we will continue to sing his praises because he has given us the opportunity to witness, (like Jeffery and others have done in the past), a real WRC machine bred with blinding speed and built with technological and mechanical wizadry fit for a fighter jet.To the Colonel I extend my gratitude for the presence of such a ride on our&nbsp; tiny but stalwart shores.With that understood I will switch &lsquo;focus&rsquo; for a while. During the lunch break I visited the pit area occupied by the Moodies, the Andersons, other family members and friends. It was obvious that they were all having a whale of a time. They were all in my estimation aware of what was to come and they were loving every moment of it. In my previous piece, Vernam Round 1 I did comment on the fact that the Moodies, Gregg and others were absent. They came this time around and they were not willing to sit and watch others run con rods and pistons through their hard earned victory laced reputations. PJ was present and he had a message to deliver. {mosimage}<br /> <br /> Doug&rsquo;s ride based on what I was told was not at its handling best and as expected in these F1 type events where every millisecond counts an evil handling ride is your worst enemy. This was reflected in the times but he was still able to post a best time of 1.57.48,the same best time posted by Garth Moodie who shared the Moodie flagship with his brother PJ. Jeffrey is always a good driver to watch .A word of advice, if you want to know how some drivers achieve the times they do watch them on track. Listen to their engines as the ride goes around the track, note their lines, their braking points, where they shift, their entry exit speed etc. I guarantee you will gain valuable knowledge. Jeffrey is silky smooth and he does all his maneuvers with the type of ease and accuracy only an adept driver can accomplish. Standing at the top of the circuit close to the big sweeper it was a pleasure to watch the EVO 9 slice its way through the circuit. Jeffery finished third in class with a best time of 1.55.98. <br /> <br /> I will return to PJ now (Peter Moodie Jr.).PJ has not competed at similar events for a little time now, we were wondering if he was going to pull a Mika Hakkinen (leave the arena without an adequate explanation) . Thanks to the Red Stripe Gods he did not. He cleaned his driving boots, had his ear full of instructions from the wisdom center ( Peter Moodie Snr), went out and reminded us why he was named Peter Moodie Jr. He can drive the wheels off anything he sits in !The Moodie machine which had a huge FOR SALE ad on its doors played its part in selling itself. It may still be one of the few performance enhancers males can still buy without going to a pharmacy. It performed flawlessly all day. The driver did his duty by showing us what we could own for a sum of 30,0000 US dollars, spares included. PJ, aided by a considerable measure of forced induction shifted his way to 1.53.30, second only to the Colonel&rsquo;s time of 1.50.55. <br /> <br /> {mosimage}The championship run saw 9 competitors completing the 3 laps with a hair raising tussle between the Colonel and PJ. Suffice it to say the Colonel was the victor but this further confirms not only PJ&rsquo;S ability, but also the quality of the workmanship that goes into a Peter Moodie prepared machine, which has narrowed the gap between the Focus and this ride which will belong to some lucky bustard in a short while. Envious &ndash; most definitely, if I had the means I would be sleeping at the steps of the Moodie performance shop on Lyndhurst road in a bid to ensure that my money is the first offer they receive. <br /> <br /> At the end of the championship run Jeffery was seen doing a brief test in the Colonel&rsquo;s Focus. Should we take anything from this. Lets wait and see. <br /> <br /> There was little to complain about at this event and unlike Dover most race fans would have left not with mixed reactions but instead a broad grin of appreciation which accompanies satisfaction. To give you an idea of how pleased the spectators were some actually stayed to watch the prize giving ceremony. Success is becoming a feature of JMMC&rsquo;S events which augurs well for motor sports. Bring it on! <br /> <br /> <br /> Machine Deh Ya !',1,1,0,1,'2006-07-23 08:47:25',62,'','2006-07-26 19:24:32',62,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-07-23 08:44:10','0000-00-00 00:00:00','articlePics/DSC02507.jpg|left||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/DSC02561.jpg|right||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/DSC02587.jpg|left||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/DSC02598.jpg|right||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/DSC02638.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=',5,0,14,'','',0,7),(19,'Sprint # 2 In Mo-Bay','Sprint # 2 In Mo-Bay','I can vividly remember listening to fellows relive the time they had when they went to an event in Ironshore ,St. James.

This is a never-ending issue and I am of the view that this is a part of what makes us men &ndash; our ability to take some unimportant issue and argue about it as if our lives depended on the outcome.&nbsp;','All in all it allows us to pass time in a constructive manner, discussing topics which our women rarely understand but have to appreciate, accommodate and accept as being an integral part of who we are (that is, if they want us to continue associating with them). Which real car guy does not spend more time or money on his ride than his girl. We will argue tooth and nail about that at a next garage session. <br /> <br /> That said, I was growing sick of persons comparing the Honda Integra Type R with every ride that could spring to mind. It is always amazing how persons who behave as if they know a lot about cars usually utter things which make you wonder - where were condoms the night of their conception. In short form, if and when you consult material written by experts you will notice that rides are usually compared to similar rides in their classes or price range. In other words rides may be compared based on the segment of the market they fall in, their displacement, forced induction or naturally aspirated etc. So under normal circumstances you would not want to compare rides, which are as different as night and day. <br /> <br /> So there I was sitting and listening to yet another heated but fun debate about the Type R and some other ride. Sometimes, the outcome of these debates are predictable, because the rule of thumb in some of these debates is simple, the loudest speaker usually wins. It does not matter if the facts are laid on the table for all to see by the less vocal speaker, he will be crushed like a menacing scorpion .The louder you are the more likely it is that you will emerge as the national garage champion. The knowledgeable individuals who were listening will then comment after the loudmouth leaves the garage and have a good laugh at his folly and obvious ignorance (not the patois one the English one ).<br /> <br /> As I listened intently to what was being said I had one of those Eureka moments. I have read all there is to read about the Honda Integra Type R (ITR), I have seen the ITR on Best Motoring, competing in Speed World Challenge, you name it, but I have neither driven one nor been in one. The little that I know has always taught me that, as it relates to motor-sports the best opinion you can form is from seat of the pants experience. You can read all you want, use a simulator if you must, but nothing compares with the real thing. So right there and then I decided to leave the fold and go in search of an ITR in order to get my seat of the pants experience and then I would report my findings to my misguided friends about this ride which persons obviously love to hate.<br /> <br /> Based on the fact that the debate centered around the 1990&rsquo;s ITR and not the more recent models, I decided that I wanted to feel the older models first and then at a later date I would sample the newer models (so there, I had a plan).<br /> <br /> {mosimage}Leroy &lsquo;ICE&rsquo; Spence is one of those persons who I usually see at one of my hangouts, Probe Auto Center on Derrymore Rd. Leroy is known as a &lsquo;motor sports activist&rsquo; and he wears many caps. He is Drag Racing&rsquo;s current fourteen (14) second class champion, he does a little dexterity, he is a marshal at events, he is an administrator, he participates at Mobay&rsquo;s Wet and Slide events, he is a member of Team RS Racing and recently he decided to dip his feet into rallying(navigator of the Mountain Dew sponsored Honda Civic Type R).Unfortunately due to a technicality he was unable to compete in the recently held rally in Mo Bay .ICE, true to name, is also one of the coolest characters you will ever come across. Simply put a straight up, down to earth, level headed fellow who is enthusiastic about motor-sports. Of what relevance is ICE to this quagmire, drum roll please &ndash; ICE owns a Honda Integra Type R<br /> <br /> When I contacted Ice and told him what I had in mind, being the typical car guy he indicated that it could be done &ndash;just the time thing to be worked out. A couple days later we went by his freezer (home) to take a few pictures of the ride(which may be seen on these pages).The Type R is not one of those drop dead gorgeous rides or anything that will take your breath away. It is more one of those rides that true motor heads will see and appreciate for the ground breaking car it was and still is. Here was a little ride sitting in the parking lot at ICE&rsquo;S freezer, a sniper on a break, not a care in the world. Little would you know that sitting in the same spot was a purpose built race car for all those who were fortunate to own one (more on that later). Today we were just shooting pictures and listening to a few of ICE&rsquo;s stories about his beloved ride. We shared a few laughs, listened to more stories, after which we left to return another day for the pedal to the metal session.<br /> <br /> ICE had concerns about both the traffic and time, so we opted for a day when there would be little activity but we still had time concerns. Eventually I made the decision that it would be best to have something, in comparison to nothing at all, so a brief session was planned with hopefully another session in the pipeline.<br /> <br /> New day in the parking lot, same thought, how is it possible for a such a world renowned ride to give the impression that it is uninspiring or uninteresting. For the unobserving eye, without the letters or the emblems, strategically placed on this ride, there is not much distinguishing the ITR from a clean, lowered Integra of the same year. With the ride now warmed thanks to a few minutes idling to get the juices circulated, we were ready to roll.<br /> <br />  Ice&rsquo;s ride is a 1997 Type R and minus a few paintwork infractions it is in pristine condition. As I got in and took my seat I immediately realized how low you sit(motor-heads know it is all about weight distribution).I was quick to identify with the sentiments expressed by Nicky Grist(former navigator for then WRC driver and former champion Colin MCcRAE),who said that in the world rally car, the navigator sits so low and far back you can barely see the road &ndash; the beauty of pace notes. Not that I could not see the road, I just thought about what he said when I realized how low I was sitting. In any ride assessment you must get a feel of how the ride does the little things as well as the things which impress us most. The Type R can be driven to the brunch, or may be used to carry your mother to the class of &rsquo;73 reunion and she would have no clue that her son tricked her into buying a race car for him.<br /> <br />  {mosimage}Looking at the Type R you will notice that it comes equipped with very sporty seats, which are not regularly found in production vehicles. Yes you can read and you saw the bold RECARO stitched on the seats but you will not understand what the letters mean until you sit in them. These seats give much needed body hugging and lateral support. No moving around, legs and body flailing about during the &lsquo;shock and awe&rsquo; display when you begin to track down an EVO. All this time we were cruising making our way to areas where we could nail it, if only briefly. True drivers know that driving is an art which requires thought and precision when executing tasks and it always amuses me how persons change from talking and laughing to suddenly serious and focused(this happened on numerous occasions). As soon as we had a clear stretch of road Ice would wake up the pistons and the revs would climb to an almost insurmountable peak. At this stage you begin to notice how the attitude of the ride changes based on the drivers orders. Of note was the suspension, this was no Lexus, this was a performance ride with taut suspension built to keep in tandem with the rides abilities. The ride was not harsh, just firm enough to let you know that evil lurks within. Typical Jamaican bumpy surfaces and performance suspension, I was loving every minute of the little run.<br /> <br />  We got the opportunity every now and then to unleash a little fury and Ice was more than willing to oblige. Each time the pedal was depressed the battle between good and evil was fought at length and I was thrilled when evil won. This ride has split personalities. Good exists below 5000 rpm. Above 5000 rpm, the devil in hell on its hottest day assisted by his chief partners in flames could not generate enough evil to defeat the evil side of this twisted production ride.<br /> <br />  There are persons who love to hear VTEC engaged and when a Honda passes, you may hear persons asking &lsquo;you hear the VTEC&rsquo;? There is no comparison between being outside of the ride and being inside of the ride when this masterful stroke of engineering occurs in the Type R. When I heard the VTEC engaged from the passenger seat in this ride at 5800 rpm Beyonce Knowles of Destiny Child fame with her mellifluous voice could not deliver a more gratifying note, Stone Love with the good old House of Leo dub plates would have lost the clash from the first round and the angels in heavens choir were searching frantically for a chord to reproduce the harmony emanating from the feet of the metallurgy gods. The sound produced from the power seeking ,disturbed, Japanese conceived rendition of mechanical wizardry which is VTEC in the ITR will leave you bewildered, your mouth agape and your adrenalin level threatening to lift the roof of your skull . That is how intense it was for me in the Type R!<br /> <br /> As we streaked down the Boulevard I was almost hoping that we could drive all the way to Ocho Rios or even Montego Bay. The ride&rsquo;s perfectly dialed in suspension allows you to easily leave the right bumper of a ride give the VTEC a song or two and blend with the common folk further down the road. All you have to do is counter your adrenalin with a little sanity. In a short while I noticed that Ice was making a U turn and then he pulled over and said &ndash;&ldquo;your turn&rdquo;. Ward 21 at the UHWI is a place for special people. Ice is a step or two from the door to that hallowed Ward. He was actually going to allow me to drive his prized possession. OK &ndash; I got into drive mode, put on my serious face, looked focused and prepared for the battle at hand. As I have suggested the Type R appears docile and this held true when I left the start point in first gear. First gear engaged, a few blips of the throttle an easy release of the clutch, cannot afford to stall, do not want to scare ICE .I quickly joined the other rides in one of the two lanes and feeling like the black slave driver with the big whip I decided to let them feel the fury. In the time it takes to check the rear view I was giving it to them . A blue ride on the left, second gear steer a little to the right depress accelerator, watch the revs soar, VTEC engaged, Pavarotti and friends harmonizing their most recent piece from the engine compartment, a quick shift at 8000 rpm, a white ride approaching, pedal depressed again, the white ride gave up without fighting, feel the rush, eased up a little and removed my head from the clouds. The rapidly approaching stoplight brought me back to earth, if only for a while.<br /> <br />  All the way up the Boulevard and onto other areas I was enjoying the ITR, the suspension left nothing to be desired, the steering responded well to the directives given and the gear box is a gem. At one stage I remember saying to ICE that I could do this all day. If given the opportunity, trust me I would . The experience left an indelible mark in my mind and as I will always argue, stop the talking and start driving . One of the few modifications on this ride was the brakes, courtesy of the Prelude and the benefits could be seen. As explained and experienced while on my brief stint the ride braked well with good stopping distances, pedal response did not leave room for uncertainty and according to ICE there is no brake fade even after hard and extended driving.<br /> <br /> When we returned to base I stood for a while admiring the ride and I must tell you I was glad that debate ensued at the garage in my presence. It led me on a path which left wide smiles of appreciation for what must be another example of the fine tuned well honed abilities of the little people known as the Japanese. During my cool down session we were joined by JB also of Team RS Racing and the ride stories continued. Car people &ndash; good people. In my next piece &ndash; yes there will be a follow up piece, I will give you more happenings about this sweet ride . I deserve a longer drive . <br /> <br /> Machine Deh Ya.',1,1,0,1,'2006-07-26 17:53:42',62,'','2006-07-26 19:22:18',62,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-07-26 17:47:10','0000-00-00 00:00:00','articlePics/ice_01.jpg|left||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/ice_02.jpg|left||0||bottom||\r\narticlePics/ice_03.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=',6,0,12,'','',0,4),(21,'Mandeville Mayhem - Vernamfield 19/ 02/ 06','Mandeville Mayhem - Vernamfield 19/ 02/ 06','<span>As Welcome As A Rainstorm In Hell</span><br /><br />Cory spoke to me from as far back as the Pure Vision roll-out to Mandeville about this event. I made a note of it on my events calendar and bearing in mind that Cory , Marlon and company are friends of mine from my days living in Mandeville I did not plan to miss it for the world.&nbsp;','I had previously checked the calendar and there was a clash with JKA&rsquo;S meet at the Palisadoes. But &ndash; a friend ting- so the decision was a foregone conclusion all things being equal I would be at Vernam the 19/02/06.<br /> <br /> During the week leading up to the event I made a few stops at a number of popular hangouts and several tuning shops. While I was at one of the spots I realized that this event, through word of mouth and the &lsquo;net&rsquo; had received mega- publicity. On Thursday,16/02/06 I went to Pure Vision&rsquo;s landmark, (the Big Tree) and they all indicated that Sunday, the place to be was Vernam. On Saturday I spoke to Kyle and Chico who were on their way to Vernam to give their rides a proper flogging . Yes, Saturday(their rides will be on yaadrides in a little while). At Auto Source on Saturday, there was a lively conversation in progress when I arrived and the consensus was &ndash; Vernam on Sunday.<br /> In essence what I initially thought would be a little gathering of motor-heads was shaping up to be a massive event.<br /> <br /> I had 2 links to make early Sunday morning so I decided to address them earlier and then head to Vernam. Pepsi had already ruled herself out of the flex with one of her unable to reschedule engagements so I was fully aware that I would be left with the photographing duties. First link - dealt with in no time- second link &ndash; do a brief driving impression of &lsquo;ICE&rsquo;s Type R (article soon) and then met with Darren, Burger and company of the Fifth Gear Crew and we were off to Vernam.<br /> <br /> On route the roads were busy with rides of all sizes ,makes and models, most in cruise mode heading towards the expanse of flat land we know as Vernam. I must apologise to the fellows in the white EVO V who were stopped earlier by the traffic cops. I was not paying as much attention to the rear view as I should have been so when I switched lanes I messed up their momentum. I did not realize you were gaining that fast &ndash; nice ride though &ndash;.I was also stopped by the cops but after a brief discussion covering various topics I introduced them to the website, (they were motor-heads as well)gave them a couple www.yaadrides cards and sped off on my merry way.(We are going to do a little feature on the Highway 2000 patrol rides)<br /> <br /> On the second leg of the highway I saw a black Toyota Corolla FX and a Nissan in a little battle so I joined just to keep it exciting. There is no fun in running by yourself. When I passed the FX I would call him each time it was clear so we were both busy darting in and out of the line of traffic. Good run my yute. <br /> <br /> Rejoined the Fifth Gear Evo 3 a little beyond the May Pen round- a &ndash;bout and before we could get to the turn off to Vernam out of nowhere we saw what most owners of &lsquo;fast machines &lsquo;do not want to see &ndash; Janspeed&rsquo;s Bright Blue Evo (see pics).Burger, driving the Evo 3 got all excited and for the first time he stepped up a notch and was actually driving the Evo. His ride is still work in progress and not wicked yet &ndash; not to worry my yute &ndash; link Bolt an yu criss. Janspeed was in laid back mode so we all just rolled slowly into Vernam. As expected as soon as Janspeed hit the concrete he had to wake up Vernam-fireworks-bomb sounds the works &ndash; in typical Janspeed fashion.<br /> <br /> Remember this was not an official meet ,but when we arrived you could not have known this. Rides were lined up in what would appear to be a traffic jam .Only difference being these rides were racing each other and each driver was beside the ride he was about to race. As 2 rides left the line 2 more rides were preparing for their turn. No timing lights, no time slips, just a fellow in the middle starting the races &lsquo;PinkSlip&rsquo; style. Now this is what racing is all about- old school racing at its best. See a ride, think your ride is quicker, link the driver or the crew, make a challenge, drivers agree to race , line up at the start point and blast down the quarter when it is your turn- engine screaming , clutch foot trembling, brakes forgotten and the gas pedal flattened on the floor almost protruding through the metal trying to get more out of the ride than it can possibly give. <br /> <br /> A large part of the reason why this event had such a major fun factor had to do with the fact that there was intense competition from all angles and there was no let up. No break, from the time we arrived until we left (when lights were being used by drivers who were still racing). The fact that anyone could race was too much to resist, so all the crews which had a little machine would send their representative out and provide the cheerleading required to boost the drivers confidence level. I must tell you that this will go down as a memorable event .All the personalities you would expect to see at a major event were not only present but had a little participation or a ride racing in the event. The Nismo banner was initially carried by the Williams brothers who brought 2 of their machines. Cleve Speed himself was seen keeping a check on things, Kitty directed the struggling for traction Pulsar down the quarter a couple times and eventually the other Portmore mad Nissans took to the track. If you were asked which make was the most dominant in terms of presence the response would lead you to the Honda Heads all over. Hondas of all sizes ,modifications and various states of tune were present and they raced until in some cases there was no more fuel. Fuel well spent. Damion Crosgill is one person who would come to mind he raced until he was visibly tired. His machine performed flawlessly all day under the Naturally Aspirated banner.<br /> <br /> Craig Lue and company rolled through, went to the line and gave us a peek into the potential of his Evo and then spectated for most of the afternoon. Bolt and the Auto Source family were accounted for. Raymond made a couple runs with his Evo and had difficulty finding competitors due to the dominance of his ride. He eventually found Wrx friends who were willing to step up and race they did. The outcome was not important, run for the fun of it .He eventually had a little clutch trouble and joined the rest of us unfortunate blokes spectating. Janspeed as usual, had the wicked ride parked for all of the afternoon until the end when most persons left, he brought it out just to show the die hards who were still there in the night a sample of what the machine could do. So with all systems up and running he went for what must be a thrill ride down the quarter - Flames a throwing and all. Brilliant!<br /> <br /> Cory drove every single ride he had a hand in . I don&rsquo;t think any one drove as often as he did. I am now of the opinion that he had that planned all along &ndash; organise a little meet so I can drive all my friends fast rides that I helped put together .I envied you my friend. Being the &lsquo;nuff&rsquo; person that I am I had to get a drive down the quarter. Not having a wicked machine present I went with Cory in Marlon&rsquo;s ride. I know that Marlon&rsquo;s ride is a 1500cc SOHC engine with a Massive turbo (see pics) and a little electronic wizardry so I was thinking this should be a nice little ride. Blame me for ignorance. I was talking to Cory before he &lsquo;staged&rsquo; the ride and it was at that time I realized that he actually built most of the rides he was actually driving. Marlon was always a good friend of mine and I was happy to know that he had a ride which on the face of it was a well sorted ride. Now I would have the opportunity to get a seat of the pants experience. When it was our turn to line up Cory&rsquo;s expression changed to race mode with heightened concentration &ndash; the revs rose according to the starter&rsquo;s instructions &ndash;both hands raised &ndash; one finger - two fingers and the drop of the hand We left the line as if we were shot from a canon, with the ride begging for traction &ndash;redline - second is engaged in a heartbeat we are half a ride length ahead of the other ride &ndash;redline - shift &ndash; the surging acceleration pushing you against the seat &ndash;Cory&rsquo;s right foot crushing the gas pedal as if it were a threatening scorpion &ndash;limiter- shift- the ride still accelerating like a rabid cheetah in full pursuit &ndash; end of the quarter&mdash;Spectating is no fun the real fun is in the driving or in my case being in a wicked ride when it is being flogged mercilessly. Twenty pounds of boost on a little 1500cc motor- crazy adrenaline rush.. Now that is addictive. Marlon your ride was much more than I had expected from 1500cc SOHC with boost ! The ride pulled with an insanity I do not think Bellevue could counter. If I was not already a believer I would now be its main advocate - BOOST IS THE REPLACEMENT FOR DISPLACEMENT !<br /> <br /> The bikers got involved at various intervals and at one stage Tallman was willing to bet 10G&rsquo;s that another bike could not defeat his machine. Morgie was also busy reminding himself of his bike days taking Tallman&rsquo;s bike for a quick run every now and then. Chris of AK 47 fame, was also involved, keeping the name Na Nu Head alive with his antics on track Entertainment was provided by 1 Pound driving the mad old Escort. While he was busy melting the tyres from the rim with his exploits, his girl was as calm as the sea, when Jesus woke up and said &ldquo;peace be still&rdquo; She obviously knows that her man has skills and as such she was the least bit perturbed as the Escort was hurled in every possible direction and angle the Vernam concrete would allow.1 Pound and the crew definitely represented and as per usual Charles ran his Mitsubishi all day. These fellows are more than die hard racers as Portmore night racers will tell you. Long after the crowd is gone 1 Pound, Charles and company are usually still at it until a little before sunrise.<br /> <br />  .For all the persons who did not attend you missed out big time. I wrote in an earlier piece that Mandeville was making their mark and this event will only serve to further that effort. To all the Mandeville riders &ndash;much love &ndash; keep up the good work &ndash; Cory keep me informed and I will be at your events to let the world see what I have always known &ndash; &lsquo;Machine deh a Mandeville&rsquo;.<br /> <br /> Do not be mistaken this event benefited from all crews participating from the various parishes and possibly we need more of that to get all the people out to the various motor sports events &ndash; no conflicts or controversy &ndash; simply racing or link ups for the fun of it.

How do I know that the sport gains new fans each event ? If you are at an event long enough or you simply have the ears of an elephant (inquisitive) &ndash;like myself you may just overhear someone asking ,&ndash;what exactly are they doing ? or why are they doing that ? Unlike a dexterity which places a huge emphasis on skill, the use of the E-brake or powerslides to navigate around for example cones, done on, at times, various surfaces, a sprint is really a test if speed. What some persons would refer to as precision driving against the clock. Emphasis on the speed and handling capabilities of the ride. Assuming that your ride is worthy, after inspection, the aim is to complete the pre-arranged course on a uniform surface in this case concrete in the shortest possible time (no 180 or 360 degree turns) As per usual, rides compete in various classes based on engine capacity, modifications, location and number of drive wheels. Sounds exciting - believe me it is!<br /> <br /> When we arrived the event had already begun but the competitors were still doing their first runs so we did not miss much. A large crowd was on hand by 12:30 pm, thanks to advertising, and based on crowd response the individuals present were loving every moment of the action. Persons who usually complain about not being able to see the happenings were pleasantly surprised by the &lsquo;flat-beds&rsquo; which were provided for them to stand on so they all had the best seats in the house.<br /> <br /> The person or persons who took the decision to place a working microphone in the hands of Mr. Bisnott should receive Jamaica&rsquo;s highest honour for bravery at the next ceremony held on the lawns of King&rsquo;s House. Mr. Bisnott is an individual who you usually hear ages before you see him and he is usually giving a joke relating to either a driver or his ride (motor-sports jokes). A loud but jovial character who you can count on to keep spectators entertained with his outbursts and remarks, especially during rally stages. So at Vernamfield commentary or a gear by gear description was provided by Mr. Bisnott who decided to let it all hang out with his no holds barred comments. This was done in good spirits and was well received by the spectators who were not allowed to endure a dull moment during his &lsquo;performance&rsquo;.<br /> <br /> On track, the times and the performances were rapidly outpacing the bonfire, which was the lava like Clarendon afternoon. Are you the proud owner of a Suzuki Swift ? You would respond with a resounding yes each time the Golding family took to the concrete. There is nothing more to be said about the Goldings achievements with the Swift that has not been said before. They have made their mark and have a loyal group of fans. Noel Jr. continues to shine and as usual his ability was on display while driving the well built Suzuki Cultus. The old school did not skip a beat. Jeremy Groves, Alan Chen driving rear wheel drive Toyota Starlets, Al Alie driving his tail happy Toyota Corolla DX, Steve Sirgany and Willie Worton driving the &lsquo;blast from the past&rsquo; Dodge Avenger stood up and were counted. There is something about a rear wheel drive relic that will always leave an approving nod from die hard enthusiasts. These rides are always crowd favourites largely due to the fact that these rides are notorious for their powerslides and based on the design of the course (the sweeper at the top of the course), a power slide will be apart of the main course whenever these rides are on track. Just in case the knife edge driving did no facilitate a powerslide during the run, one of the drivers may just decide to relive the glory days with a series of 360&rsquo;s, as was masterfully illustrated by Jeremy Groves at the end of one of his scorching runs.<br /> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Yaadrides.com</span><br /> <br /> Mitsubishi Japan or Ralliart should have been at Vernam. Team Xpress Racing came out in full battle gear, clad in their team shirts, machines lubed and ready to go. Led by their able leader Raj they stoutly defended the reputation of the Mitsubishi RS. As if by design each time Raj approached the section of the course immediately before the team tent, he was able to skillfully manoeuvre the ride on 3 wheels, return it to a neutral stance and continue without a blip in the throttle-much to the delight of the spectators.<br /> <br /> The Mitsubishi flag was also flown by the Andersons, Bobby Marshal, Junior &lsquo;Fletty&rsquo; Barnes, Haresh Ramchandani,Andrew and Daryl King. Ferdinand Anderson&rsquo;s Mitsubishi Mirage owned its class and it is always a pleasure to see that ride in action bearing in mind what the stock ride is like. I have not seen Fletty in action for quite some time now and this time around like the previous occasions I was not disappointed. His machine is a well prepared ride and he has the driving abilities to match the rides potential. He made no incorrect steering input, he was silky smooth.<br /> <br /> If Fletty was silky smooth what will I say about young Daryl King. Daryl is from a motor-sports family and as such it could be said that he is from good stock, but at days end you will have to prove yourself. In every discipline there are always persons who are known by persons on the inside to be good, but they are not &lsquo;out there&rsquo; as yet .The secret is no more . Ladies and gentlemen allow me to introduce you to Daryl King (this is where you applaud).Daryl did not only drive the Mitsubishi Lancer 6 &frac12; .He obliterated the lovely paintwork from the panels of the ride with his ferocious attack on the course. He whipped every last horse buried in the Japanese motor and with amazing speed and control he emerged as Vernams quickest with a jaw dropping 1:57.195.King of the Hill, Top of the Top. Watch this fellow he has something to offer. To put his time in perspective check the results, look at the rides in the various classes and then you will begin to understand his achievement. Suffice it to say that all of Montego Bay was informed of his time in less than a gearshift. When the ride returned to its tent after Andrew&rsquo;s run( he was imprisoned on the track by Mr Bisnott so he had to watch Andrew&rsquo;s run), it was packed with friends and spectators and his cell phone could not leave his ears. Instant celebrity thanks to the JMMC and a little place called Vernam.<br /> <br /> Other Mobay drivers who were present include club president Dean Corrodus and Doug &lsquo;Hollywood&rsquo; Gore. Doug was without his usual &lsquo;beast&rsquo; so he could not launch an attack on the unsuspecting prey. Fortunately he was rescued by Starsky and Hutch. Jimmy&rsquo;s ride a Toyota Corolla FX with a Starsky and Hutch paint job is a perfect example of a low buck ,well built, sweet, machine of speed. The good fellow he is, Jimmy gave Doug his ride to drive. My dear friends, Doug could not help himself. The pistons in that ride has never seen or felt such heightened activity. Doug revved it as if there was no tomorrow and then some. To the engine builder of that car I say &ldquo;good work boss&rdquo;. It survived Doug&rsquo;s super heavy right foot without even a puff of smoke. You could see Jimmy beaming with pride during Doug&rsquo;s runs. In true Hollywood fashion Doug had to entertain. If he was given a bicycle to compete and you would still have a show. At the final section of the course before the finish line, Doug had the ride &lsquo;full sideways&rsquo;, pleading for traction, not lifting (remember heavy right foot) before deftly applying opposite lick and then blasting by the checkered flag. Crowd response &ndash; think Stadium when Jamaica qualified for the World Cup!<br /> <br /> There is something happening in Mandeville and I am not certain if Jamaica is taking notice. I was fortunate enough to spend a couple years in Mandeville and I know for a fact that this town fits the definition of the term Car Crazy. Mandeville is not as prominent on the Jamaican motorsports map as Kingston and Mobay but thanks to work being done by various crews in the bauxite/alumina mecca the word is getting out loud and clear.<br /> <br /> Xavier Murray, I am convinced, has a team of Japanese Honda engineers on his payroll. This dimunitive individual who is an amazing tuner is working Honda magic in the cool hills of Mandeville (it must be the cool air). Who would have thought that a Honda could consistently and fearlessly lay down the performance and the times we see being done by Teddy Burton&rsquo;s sick, M.A.D, engine too good, jacked up on racing gas ride. This ride is rapidly reorganizing the seat of dominance on the Jamaican motor-sports scene. The ride driven by both Teddy and Xavier continued to impress with a remarkable performance. Teddy produced the quickest time for the day for an extended period before being dethroned by Daryl and even in the Championship Run Fletty&rsquo;s winning time of 2:59.015 was not even a full second quicker than Xavier&rsquo;s 2:59.765 (Daryl did not start in the Championship Run due to mechanical failure).Teddy and Xavier&rsquo;s performance prove that they are both much more than just competent with the circle and stick (steering and gear shift ) at these types of events. If you are an enthusiast you need to hear this ride exiting a chichane with its Formula 1 wail, surpassing 9000 rpm, and then my friends you will begin to understand and appreciate the work being done by the M.A.D. crew. Welcome to Sprints Mandeville &ndash; long overdue.<br /> <br /> Quite a few of the popular personalities/rides were missing in action this time around including Gary Gregg, the Moodie&rsquo;s and others. We hope that they will be out and about next Sprint. We are greedy, we would love to see ALL the top rides on show.<br /> <br /> This meet was a huge success &ndash; there was a large turnout the machines and drivers were obviously in their best state of tune and preparedness, the fans were thoroughly entertained and we all saw the debut of the M.A.D. machine at Sprints and the emergence of a promising driver. Is it true that Fletty is relocating to Kingston or was that just apart of commentators entertainment package.<br /> <br /> The JMMC is definitely on a roll &ndash; Who said Mr Henriques was going around trying to secure some race gas for competitors (he was overheard asking &ldquo;you have any gas&rdquo;?).It is said that Fletty is in negotiations trying to collect payment for his marshalling duties (he was kept busy preventing spectators from crossing the track)<br /> <br /> Good fun JMMC &ndash; with events like this on a Sunday who worries about silly bosses on a Monday.

Organisers usually advertise events as a family affair to encourage persons to attend, with the thought being you can carry the children and every one can have a good time. If there ever was an event which could be dubbed a family affair then this must be it. The children do not only come to watch the races, the children are also competitors! Colin Daley Jr. is eight years old and he is a no-nonsense competitor. Dwight Moore, victorious in Race 2 in the Rotax Masters Class could be seen urging his sons on during their races. Every turn of the steering and each movement of the pedals were watched by fathers<span>&nbsp; </span>and other family members including Peter Rae and Peter Moodie Snr.<span>&nbsp; </span>Christopher Myers&rsquo;s father could not keep his cool and his level of excitement was obvious for all to see with each overtaking manoeuver made by Chris during the races. Moving through the pit area you are reminded of the formula 1 events . The attention given to these karts is unbelievable and what was even more startling is the fact that quite a few of<span>&nbsp; </span>Jamaica&rsquo;s top drivers and mechanics could be seen involved at one stage or another.</span></p>  <br /> <p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>  <br /> <p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial\">The races were entertaining, the level of competition was fierce and as such there were a number of minor on track incidents which comes with the territory when you have close competition and individuals vying for top spots.&nbsp;</span></p>  <br /> <p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>  <br /> <p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial\">While at the event I was able to speak to several competitors and it was obvious that this was a jovial and laid back but competitive atmosphere.

But this in my estimation is just as a result of the appreciation being shown by all persons for what this crew is doing. The package that they have conceived is being done for the first time in this manner and even more remarkable is the fact that it is being done weekly (every Saturday night ). </span></p>  <br /> <p class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\"><span>For first timers (males) get there between 11:30 and 12am.You<span>&nbsp; </span>will have the opportunity to see and lust after some of Jamaica&rsquo;s finest.

This may involve stops at various towns,cities,etc. and it may take anywhere from a few hours to several days on the road (what my Caucasian friends would refer to as a road-trip ).When we at Yaadrides heard about this event we were more than willing to support the effort.&nbsp;','I for one admire the effort being made by various individuals, groups entities etc. in promoting and exposing the wonderful lifestyle involved in the fun filled environment which is &ndash;all things ride (automobile ) related.<br /> <br /> Based on the information we received, we were informed that departure time from the Texaco gas station was 8:30 pm. We were not betting on that time, bearing in mind that this is the land the we know as YAAD and I am almost certain that if Jamaicans were given a specific time at which they should be present to collect their lottery winnings the company would not need to disburse one red cent in lottery winnings (each winner would arrive late). We do not adhere to stated times ! We were on location by&nbsp; 8 pm just to see the happenings and at that time it was obvious that a little excitement was in the air. The various crews were rolling in, one or two rides at a time. The Wheelers were present, rides wearing Pure Vision stickers were present, Oniel and the other hype Nismo representatives were present and so on the list goes. What was evident is the effort made by many men to get the women onboard. The women represented and they came appropriately attired &ndash; Dressed to give the men HELL. No complaints &ndash; the Yaadrides photographer took her candid shots and had to flee a group of Wheelers who wanted to &lsquo;confiscate&rsquo; her for the night. It was all in the name of fun and the vibe at the station was flowing constantly from all the gas pumps. All the rides which were at the location did spend a little time at the pumps just to ensure that the ride was well fed. Who wants to stop for ride food (fuel) during the nitrous injected, flame throwing spectacle which we were all certain would be an integral part of the fire we were about to blaze on route to Mandeville. <br /> <br /> By 10 pm the various rides had assembled and persons were itching to go. Some rides had already left and the remaining rides wanted to leave in unison. We went ahead inorder to take relevant shots. When the rides eventually rolled out you could see a long line of &lsquo;superclean&rsquo; rides traveling along I 95 onto Highway 2000. I was honoured to witness this event. This is a ride lover&rsquo;s moment, I had to soak it in. The machines were in full effect and do not think for one minute that recklessness prevailed. Enthusiasts know the potential of their rides and it was clear &ndash; the slower moving rides kept their left lane and the much, much faster rides spent all their time in the right lane. It was all good &ndash; exercise your ride. At the toll booth the lovely photographer exercised her fingers and snapped away. There was a brief stop at the toll booth as all the rides gathered again and the discussions continued. Ice and the other Wheelers, Mr. Pure Vision himself and others were all busy&nbsp; sharing stories&nbsp; and tracking the lovely ladies who were present. With all the rides reassembled and accounted for we were ready to roll again nonstop to the cool hills of Mandeville -or so we thought. On the second leg of the highway the pace stepped up a notch and this leg was purely for the swift. A collection of the Honda make of cars were busy reducing the asphalt to nothingness with their pace and every now and then you could here the beautiful sound of the turbocharged rides lapping up the cold air,their blow-off valves resonating in the cool Clarendon night. <br /> <br /> The quickened pace continued to the last corner before the turn to Vernamfield where one of the rides had a little mechanical difficulty. No worries, we are all in this together &ndash; all or most of the rides in the convoy stopped until the problem was rectified. Problem resolved and the rides extravaganza continued. Blazing through Clarendon and into Porus you could sense that the rides which were ahead stirred up some excitement in the rural folk. I can vividly remember Oniel and the Nismo camp rolling out before every one else. They must have lit an inferno through Porus &ndash; what with all their external wastegates and roaring Nismo exhaust systems scaring the humble village people. When we were passing through Porus there were persons lining the streets in an attempt to see, hear and get close to what was happening. This was after 11pm. But there were persons at various areas in lines signaling when we drove by. We welcomed the attention and responded by exercising the loud pedal a little more,- nothing less than 7000 rpm &ndash; machine !&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Exited Porus, had fun with several cars climbing the Melrose Hill bypass and even more fun climbing Winston Jones Highway (had my doors blown off by a green Nismo crew member) .I had to stop briefly to help other roll out members who were going the wrong way after the round-a-bout at the top of Winston Jones Highway and then we all headed to the meeting spot in yet another neat line. Rides rolled in to the meeting spot with engines revving, ladies cheering Wheelers and Yaadriders nodding their heads and giving thumbs up etc. showing their approval. Some persons did burnouts, Prendy spun his van several times, more 180 slides by the Hondas,&nbsp; a 360 turn every now and then the usual chatting and laughing, some more candid shots and more girl watching. In the blip of a throttle the general area where we were, before the KFC in Mandeville was filled with rides and we were then told that we should actually be on a plaza next to the KFC. The dexterity began again, to make the trek across &ndash; rides being flung sideways, 180 slides&nbsp; 360 degrees and the Touge continued. KFC could not compete with the delicious meals being offered by the drivers. The unsuspecting patrons at KFC were thrilled, KFC actually owes us for providing entertainment !<br /> <br /> On the plaza a little ride show was in progress and a set of clean rides from both Kingston and Mandeville were on display.In the ride show there were rides including Kassa&rsquo;s sweet Honda Type R, Oniel&rsquo;s Nismo monster, Albert Lowe&rsquo;s Mercedes, Nigel&rsquo;s jacked up on steroids Turbo Starlet, lister&rsquo;s Starlet and other magnificent rides.The owners were on hand to answer questions being asked by the curious enthusiasts.There were persons posing for photos and the crews mingled viewing machines from other makes .Big up to the Fifth Gear crew who represented and filmed the ride show.<br /> <br /> A Pure Vision Roll Out would not be complete without the models segment. Rollers from Kingston would be familiar with all the models but one did not get that impression when the ladies rolled out. The&nbsp; Rollers from Mandeville picked their favourite from early and you could hear cheers of heightened appreciation from both Mandeville and Kingston Rollers when one particular model rolled out. The poor Camera man did not know that rollers could behave in such a boisterous and unruly manner. One roller decided to sit at the feet of the models, restricting the poor gentleman&rsquo;s movement.&nbsp; He could not get adequate space to record at&nbsp; one stage. Did we care &ndash; hell no ! The lovely models came out and they did strut their stuff. All this time persons were streaming into the plaza. Surprisingly a lot of ladies we spoke to were from Mandeville who said they were told about the event and decided to check it out. The response I got was that they were glad they did. They thoroughly enjoyed the event.<br /> <br /> <br /> At 2:15 am&nbsp; we decided to pack it in and while outside, we heard plans being made to begin races at another location. We could still see and hear&nbsp; rides blazing up and down the strip where we were and if it was not clear before it was clear now - Kingston beware because Mandeville may just have as much rides as we have there.<br /> <br /> <br /> My view &ndash;the Pure Vision Roll Out can be used by all others as the platform from which to launch events like this. The vibe was good , the camaraderie between rollers who are diehard Honda heads Nismo souls etc was excellent, Mr Pure Vision himself was pleased busy trying to photograph the Yaadrides photographer. It was fun times 10.Good link up!&nbsp; Big up to all the Mandeville Rollers &ndash; Cory and the crew, Shevon and the other fast ride owners in Mandeville &ndash; Respect to all Wheelers who turned up and all other Kingston Rollers who came and Big up to Pure Vision for infusing some fire and uniqueness into what might have been an uneventful Friday night. Looking forward to the next event. I will keep you posted about a little Vernamfield event being planned by the Mandeville Yaadriders.

How do I know this you ask. I give to you this event dubbed Dexterity number 1. What was remarkable about this event initially is the location. This event was very close to home and as such most persons once time allowed could attend. It was also refreshing to see that actual motorsports events could be held close to the corporate area .','The JMMC should be commended for the thought and the execution of that thought.<br /> <br /> That said I will tell you what you all want to know. So Boss how was the event.? I will tell you this I shelved my plans for my usual rice and no peas at home to ensure that I was early to do the view and idle chat before the event and I have no regrets. <br /> <br /> Upon entering we were greeted by pleasant persons collecting our hard earned contribution, but what a bargain we got . A total of sixty one competitors were bold enough to step up to the plate. They put their machines to the test and entertained the fanatics who were present. The usual professional approach of the JMMC could be clearly seen, for example, the drivers meeting, the car scrutineers, the marshals ,the timing officials etc. Teach (Christopher) wore several hats. He did the demonstration run, he provided entertaining commentary and at one stage I am certain he was almost scared out of wits when he decided to perform navigator duties before the championship run in a rear wheel drive Toyota Starlet.<br /> <br /> As it relates to the persons who competed there were impressive performances all around. I was impressed with what some persons were able to do with what would be thought as underpowered cars. When you see a Nissan AD wagon, dexterity does not come to mind but that did not deter the members of Team Express Racing from wringing the performance out of that ride. Dion Gardener and Raj Jadusingh were able to throw that car around with very skilful use of the E- brake and as such were appropriately rewarded with first and second place respectively in the overall placement. When I spoke to Raj before the runs started he indicated that he was just trying to remember the course. My guess is he figured it out in a short time frame. My respect gentlemen. Daryl King driving a Honda Civic was also able to illustrate how to make a regular daily ride assume rally duties. He slid left, he slid right and then some more &ndash; well done.<br /> <br /> The event saw female competitors exercising their right feet and to the delight of the females in attendance they did not disappoint. Tanee, Kim, AnnaKay, Marcia, Gina and Natasha all did well. They came they saw and they carried the torch for the fairer sex and carried it well. Natasha did not have her regular ride so she shared the Mazda Demio with Joel Jackson of Karting fame. At one stage when I heard the ladies screaming &ldquo;Natasha&rdquo;,I drew closer to the action. She drove her only run as if she was late for her wedding. I am positive she had Joel hoping that she did not beat his time. Unfortunately she made an error and scored a DNF but is was a treat to watch the ladies competing in what is seen as a male dominated event.<br /> <br /> The Montego Bay Motoring Club did not roll out in full force but they were represented and led from the front by their able president Dean Corrodus who gave his Toyota Corolla WRC responsibilities. If you wanted a wide variety of rides in one event you could not have asked for more than what was available at this event. The run what you brung concept was alive and well.<br /> <br /> Tarik had us worried in his Toyota Rav 4 but his mini-SUV rose to the occasion and responded well to his instructions. Freddy Chin kept his VW Golf&rdquo;s name alive by showing it&rdquo;s versatility. The Type R entrants led by Sean Cameron gave a respectable showing. Steve Sirgany in his Ford Escort said he came to have fun and he had a whale of a time.Forget competing for a time he was just reminded us of the glory days of the big mmmaaaddd Escorts. The BZR camp was represented by Latham Lindo who had his companion cheering him on from trackside. Garth Chin in his Mercedes Benz did not fail to surprise us by negotiating several tight turns in one attempt which left us wondering &ndash; How did he do that ? These were turns which gave smaller cars a challenge! Several competitors had to reverse before completing these turns.<br /> <br /> Dexterity 1 would not have been complete without the presence of the all-wheel and rear wheel drive family. Enter from Stage right the Toyota Starlets driven by Allan Chen, Maurice Wittingham, Kirk Excell, Jeremy Grove and Henrik Larsen,- the Toyota Corollas driven by Al Siddique Alie and Jason McPherson and the Subaru Imprezza driven by Stephen Bansie. It is my view that these gentlemen had a separate drivers meeting and they all decided that their role for the day was to deliver the following lesson- How to Slide/ Turn a Ride without the use of the E- brake. They delivered the lesson and they delivered it well. At one stage when one of the crew realized he would DNF he just did a - to hell with it shrug and rewarded us with two 360 degree turns. The petrol intoxicated spectators loved it! Allan Chen was superb followed closely by Maurice Wittingham who even gave us the one finger in the air, one hand on steering power slide &ndash; GGOODD SSTTUUFF. Not to be outdone Stephen Bansie uncorked the WRC heritage of the Subaru. He came in his element and illustrated the beauty of all- wheel drive. Power and control &ndash; what a union.<br /> <br /> My only disappointment has to do with the performance of the Evo crew. I am certain that the drivers of the world renowned MACHINE &ndash; the Evolution line of rides share my pain(Janspeed, Bolt and crew were in attendance).The Evo&rsquo;s did not deliver as expected. Like most things excellence requires practice and I am certain that with more seat time the drivers of those rides will do their rides justice. Practice my friends and come to the next test blazing.<br /> <br /> In essence JMMC&rsquo;s first event was an overwhelming success.

If your answer is YES, this car will brighten your dull, unhappy and otherwise useless existence. Welcome to the world of the EURO R. If I could depict this with a torch blazing fire believe me I would but let me not get ahead of myself this is still only a car and as such I will treat it as just that a car. ','This ride, which was brought to life by a team of gifted Japanese engineers who had too much enthusiasm and too much racing pedigree was christened Honda Torneo Euro R for the year 2002. This ride is propelled by Honda&#39;s 2.2 litre Vtec powerplant and with minor modifications (see fact file) this is truly a POWERPLANT. My driving impression takes me to nice smooth roads in the sunshine city of Portmore, with enough twist and turns to allow a decent shakedown. Seatbelts -check, Vtec controller-check and all other things a fighter pilot would check - check. &#39;Gentlemen start your engines&#39;! The sound of this motor sets the tone of events to follow, just loud enough to remind you that the exhaust system which lurks beneath has all of 2.5 inches of aluminized piping, complete with headers and an SR muffler to efficiently remove spent gases. As we leave the parking area we clear a couple grocer getters and then it is Hammer time! This car has what may be referred to as linear acceleration. As the revs rise to 5000 rpm the Vtec controller takes over and the difference is felt immediately and what I thought was a fairly long section of roadway was getting shorter at a rapid rate. The section of roadway we were on has several straight sections with short sweeping corners. As we were about to complete the first section I was watching the speed at which we were approaching the corner. I will tell you this, brake a little just enough to position the car for your entry speed and return to <strong>HAMMER TIME!</strong> If you want to justify the expense of your Tein suspension test your ride in twisty stuff. In this ride corners do not exist. This car corners like it is on rails, this ride fells like a well built circuit racer. You hear or feel no tire squealing or begging for traction in corners, there is no scary body roll, simply turn in and 7000 rpm (or more) of screaming Honda power as you exit the corner. For the duration of my driving impression I experienced a ride that did the little things very well and then some and in my book that makes not only a satisfying ride, but also a fun ride.

At present it comes equipped with the RB20DET with an automatic transmission. Do not read automatic and hang your heads with pity. Honestly the previous 2 Skylines were standard and this will be also, in a short time. This automatic transmission was upgraded and beefed up which makes shifting this automatic an absolute joy. In all fairness a ride for me is not complete unless in has a standard gearbox which allows you to extract every little hiding horse in that engine and every little pound foot of torque that can be found. That said a gearbox will be replacing that fun filled automatic transmission and eventually an upgrade to the more powerful RB25DET. The current turbo was upgraded as well so it is much more responsive and builds boost in no time. Acceleration - don&#39;t even think about it .

','<br /><br /><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Lancer Evolution</span> <br /> The obsession. The dedication. The incremental performance gains. The weight-shaving engineering. The uncompromising purity of intention. The Lancer Evolution is one of the most purpose-driven performance cars on the planet. And each successive iteration of the car begs new creative thinking. Make more power, save more weight, brake a little deeper, clip the apex a little tighter. Come out of the corner a little harder. If you are reading this you already understand. The performance numbers are staggering. The four consecutive World Rally Championship driver&#39;s titles are legendary. The 4G63 motor code is street shorthand for dominance. It&#39;s automotive Darwinism. <br /> <br />  <strong>It&#39;s evolution.</strong> <br /> And Lancer Evolution lives up to the heritage. It now generates an incomprehensible 286 horsepower from only two-liters of displacement; this is the highest power-to-displacement ratio of any production inline four-cylinder engine in the world, at 146 horsepower produced per liter of displacement. The list of performance tweaks testifies to the vision. The refined front aerodynamics reduce lift and improve intercooler efficiency. Under the magnesium valve covers, hollow camshafts save rotational weight, and less inertia means that engine RPMs build faster and acceleration times go down. New MIVEC variable valve timing helps the engine breathe better at high revs. Aluminum roof*, hood and fender panels save weight and lower the Lancer Evolution&#39;s center of gravity. A twin-scroll turbocharger virtually eliminates turbo lag. A Vortex Generator* tunes and directs air onto the rear spoiler&#39;s new wickerbill* to generate maximum downforce at speed.<br />                     <br /> <br />  MACHINE DEH YA.</p>',1,1,0,1,'2006-07-29 15:07:11',62,'','2006-07-29 15:09:25',62,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-07-29 15:06:11','0000-00-00 00:00:00','articlePics/evoix_01.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=',3,0,3,'','',0,3),(30,'Driving a YAAD','Driving a YAAD','A group of friends from Florida planned to spend a few days in Jamaica on the north coast. Before they came here they spoke to me to rent a ride so they would be able to drive around the island while they were here. During the conversation I asked my friend who would be driving the ride. He paused before answering then he indicated that they were all competent drivers and as such they would share the driving duties. ','&nbsp;These are persons who have never driven on this little rock of ours and as such I informed him that I do not think that was a wise idea. Anyway he insisted that they were all competent and the only thing he was only asking me to rent the ride. Enough said I rented the ride.<br />  <br /> <p> After picking them up at the airport, they got the necessary instructions and directions and they were off on their merry with chants of &#39;wha gwaan mon&#39; ,&#39;Jamaica Irie mon&#39; etc. sounding all Yankee and silly. Sitting at home a few hours later soaking up some Speed TV my focus was disturbed by the ringing telephone. When I picked up the receiver I was only able to hear someone rambling ,swearing, cursing ,screaming and behaving senseless. The persons in the background sounded even worse than the person on the telephone who was on the verge of what could only be referred to as a mental collapse. The long and short of it all was the fact that they had numerous life threatening encounters with UFD&#39;s ( unidentified flying drivers) while driving from Montego Bay to Ocho Rios. The sane version of the story included several drivers overtaking around corners , being frightened or pressured by speeding, overloaded tractor trailer trucks, bicycle riders swinging into their path ,taxi drivers swerving to avoid craters in the road and the list went on. At the end of the monologue he stated that no one was willing to drive, ( so much for competent drivers ) and the ride would not cover another kilometer unless I came and provided the driving services. They are my friends and it took a lot of courage for him to call and speak in the manner in which he did and as such after laughing my head off , rolling and clutching my stomach I went and rescued my now not so &#39;irie&#39; and humiliated friends. Did I state that he referred to my local Yaad road users as Kamikaze drivers.<br /> The Yaad reality speaks to a number of factors. There are few roads on our little rock that we can speak highly of .Most of our roads were not built properly in the first place. Has anyone noticed all that is involved in constructing a road by observing what the Bougues fellows are doing on a day to day basis.This is evidence that our roads would be left wanting. Craters or potholes are as much a permanent feature of our roads as are broken and unbroken white lines. Added to this inferno is the fact that a large number of Yaad drivers did not obtain a license through the appropriate channels. The system is so designed by unscrupulous individuals that it forces persons to pay a fee, at present anywhere between eight and twelve thousand before you are rewarded with a drivers license. Ultimately if payment is involved then there is no need to spend the required time to become a proficient driver or learn road codes. There were numerous documented cases involving persons in possession of drivers licenses who were not able to read or write. Now how would you expect these persons to observe the various signs seen along roadways.</p>  <br /> <p>As road users we should ensure that we know the road codes, learn defensive driving techniques, know the capability of our rides and always bear in mind that we are not alone on the roads. We should always proceed with reduced speed on roads we are not familiar with and practice to resist our natural response to swing if we suddenly encounter a crater (pothole) or a crossing animal. Applying the brakes is obviously less costly than the accidents which often times occur due to persons swinging from potholes or animals ( unfortunately some of these accidents have resulted in the loss of life or limb).There is also the little devil known as ROAD RAGE. He or She is a dangerous character avoid confrontations on the roads, your life is much more valuable than a bent bumper.</p>  <br /> <p>In a nutshell to all my fellow Yaad rides enthusiasts and to all Yaad road users be careful on the roads.

As you consider or follow your trend of thought you will go through a jungle filled with tangled options. These options will or may include: make or model car, ease of modification, suspension system, braking or handling characteristics, 2 wheel or 4 wheel drive, turbo-charged or normally aspirated and the list can continue until you hear a deep voice saying &#39;Continue No More&#39;. <br /> <br /> ','The first time I saw and heard this car I was traveling along Old Hope Road minding my own business when my business at hand was disturbed by a melodious snarl, which could only be released from a properly built creature of speed. The snarl obviously came from the bright, beautiful yellow Turbo Starlet, which I saw hastily making its way towards Cross-roads.<br />  <br />  One week later I was given the opportunity to view, appreciate and glorify this fine example of what a completed project car should resemble. The creature was motionless, basking in the brilliant Jamaican afternoon sunshine almost showing off, much to the delight of the strangers who were present. There was no hiding the pride on the face of its humble owner.<br />  <br /> Based on the information provided and personal observation it was clear that all aspects of this car was addressed as a part of a comprehensive development program for this ride. Evidence of this may be seen in the fact that for example, the Rav 4 braking system (front brake rotor, calipers, etc.) is used on this ride because as the owner explained it significantly improves the braking capabilities of the ride.<br />  At the end of the information collection exercise it was time for the ride impression (test drive).With a turn of the key in the ignition the quiet afternoon ceased to exist. The creature was no longer still, it was now wide awake. A low growl emanated from its quarters as it awaited its masters instructions. As we left our location we travelled along one of Yaad&#39;s washboard surfaced roads (uneven).If you were not certain before it will be confirmed on this type of surface that this is no grocery getter. This is indeed built to perform and as such there is no Mercedes -like ride quality here. This ride is definitely much more at home on smooth surfaces. As enthusiasts we all know that compromise is the name of the performance and modification game. When the transition was made to a smooth section of roadway the ride felt much more at home and begged for go -juice. Snarling along at anywhere between 2000 and 3000 rpm&#39;s in second gear a long smooth, straight section of road approached. At the back of my mind I am mindful of the fact that a new phase of my relationship with this ride was about to begin. True to thought the owner applied the whip to the creature and what was previously 3000 rpm of low growling was immediately replaced with 15 lbs of turbocharged boost. Insane, mind numbing aggression and acceleration would barely explain what occurred. Even with limited slip diff and the power steering removed some amount of torque steer was still evident, but with a surgeon&#39;s precision the more than capable driver navigated the ride along the chosen path. When asked to get up and go this ride responds in a no nonsense approach and in a short while after the go juice was sent to the group of 550cc injectors the long ,smooth straight section of road was chewed up and spat out through the 3 inch exhaust system. Oh what a feeling!! This must be the solution to stress related issues (boost and more boost). In a short while we returned the creature to its humble abode and left it growling for a time to allow Mr. Turbo -timer to do his cool down exercise. <br /> <br /> During the ride impression the owner aired his views on various issues and what became obvious was his passion for performance. Fortunately he is able to pursue his passion but at the same time he remains level-headed and humble in his demeanor. That approach demands respect. Unfortunately there is not one humble bolt, nut, screw, or hose clamp on this ride. This ride snarls for attention and will growl or roar past similar rides in its class.
